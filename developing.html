        <h1 class="og" style="color: black;">Developing Filipino Identity</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">Filipino identity was created primarily as a result of pre-colonial cultures, colonial influences, and foreign traders intermixing and gradually evolving together. Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger empire outside of what is now the Philippines.</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">The term "Filipino" is originally meant a Spaniard born of Spanish parents in the Philippines. The name was given to distinguish them as a foreign-born and not a peninsular Spaniard. The term "Filipino" was only later applied to the Malay Filipino towards the end of the Spanish regime.</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">Filipinos (Filipino: Mga Pilipino) are the people who are native to or citizens of the country of the Philippines. Filipinos come from various Austronesian ethnolinguistic groups. Of the living languages, 175 are indigenous and 8 are non-indigenous.</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">The Philippines collectively are called Filipinos. The ancestors of the vast majority of the population were of Malay descent and came from the Southeast Asian mainland as well as from what is now Indonesia. Contemporary Filipino society consists of nearly 100 culturally and linguistically distinct ethnic groups.</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">Filipinos are categorized as Asians and the Philippines as part of Southeast Asia. But describing Filipinos as Pacific Islanders isn't necessarily wrong either. In fact, for a long time, Filipinos were known as Pacific Islanders.</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">The majority of the people in the Philippines are of Austronesian descent who migrated from Taiwan during the Iron Age. They are called ethnic Filipinos. The largest Filipino ethnic groups include the Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Bicolano, Kapampangan, Maranao, Maguindanao, and Tausug.</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">Though the ethnic Malays are part of the bigger Malay Race, Filipinos consider Malays as being the natives of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Consequently, Filipinos consider themselves Malay when in reality they are referring to the Malay Race.</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">The Maharlika (meaning freeman or freedman) were the feudal warrior class in ancient Tagalog society in Luzon, the Philippines. The Spanish translated the name as Hidalgos (or libres).</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">The Philippines is and the Filipinos are Hispanic, but not as conventionally Hispanic as Latin America and Latinos. The Philippines is and the Filipinos are Asian, but not as conventionally Asian as its neighbors in Southeast Asia and Asia in general.</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">Currently, only about 0.5 percent of the Philippines' 100 million-strong population speaks Spanish; however, it's still home to the most number of Spanish speakers in Asia.</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">The names of many Filipinos derive from the Spanish conquest of the Philippine Islands and its implementation of a Spanish naming system. After the Spanish conquest of the Philippine islands, many early Christianized Filipinos assumed religious-instrument or saint names.</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">In terms of genome and anthropological studies and research, the "pure Filipino" does not exist. The use of the term "Filipino" in the Philippines started during the Spanish colonial period. The original meaning was "a person of Spanish descent born in the Philippines."</p>
    
        <p class="og1" style="color: black;">The word "Filipino" is spelled with an "f" because it's derived from the Spanish name for the Philippine Islands: Las Islas Filipinas. ("Philip" is Felipe in Spanish.) In English, however, the name was translated from the Spanish as "the Philippine Islands" or "the Philippines."</p>
