            <h2>Lesson 1: Formation and Synthesis of Heavier Elements</h2>
            <h3>What is It</h3>
            <p>Stars form when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapses, leading to the creation of a protostar. The contraction of the protostar leads to an increase in temperature, starting nuclear reactions when the temperature reaches around 10 million Kelvin. This forms a main sequence star, where hydrogen fuses into helium.</p>

            <h4>Star Evolution and Heavier Elements</h4>
            <p>As the star evolves, heavier elements are formed. For example, in red giant stars, helium fuses into carbon. In massive stars, this process continues, producing neon, magnesium, silicon, and eventually iron through successive fusion stages. However, when the star can no longer sustain fusion, it may collapse into a white dwarf or explode as a supernova, dispersing these heavier elements into space.</p>

            <h5>Stellar Nucleosynthesis</h5>
            <p>Stellar nucleosynthesis is the process where heavier elements, such as beryllium (Be) and iron (Fe), are formed from lighter elements like protons and neutrons. As stars die or explode, they create these heavier elements, which are then scattered throughout the universe.</p>

            <h4>Example Reactions in Stellar Nucleosynthesis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Helium and Carbon Fusion:</strong> Helium reacts with carbon to produce oxygen and gamma rays.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon and Carbon Fusion:</strong> Carbon fuses with another carbon atom to form magnesium and gamma rays.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen and Oxygen Fusion:</strong> Oxygen fuses with another oxygen atom to form silicon and release helium and gamma rays.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Supernova Explosion</h5>
            <p>When a star’s core no longer generates enough energy to resist gravitational collapse, it explodes in a supernova, releasing a large amount of energy and heavier elements into the universe.</p>

            <h3>Pieces of Evidence</h3>
            <p>Evidence for stellar nucleosynthesis includes the discovery of interstellar dust and gases, which confirm the processes happening across the universe. Infrared radiation emitted during stellar formation also serves as an indication of the ongoing nuclear processes within stars.</p>

            <h3>Atomic Number and Synthesis of New Elements</h3>
            <p>Scientists have used atomic numbers to arrange elements in the periodic table, allowing them to predict new elements by adding protons to atoms. The number of protons in an atom defines its atomic number and the element's identity.</p>

            <h4>Nuclear Reactions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alpha Emission:</strong> A particle with two protons and two neutrons is emitted, resulting in a lighter element. Example: <code>23892U → 23490Th + 42He</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Beta Emission:</strong> A neutron becomes a proton, releasing an electron, resulting in a new element with the same mass. Example: <code>13153I → 13154Xe + 0-1e</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Gamma Emission:</strong> Gamma rays are emitted when a radioactive nucleus transitions to a lower energy state. Example: <code>13756Ba → 13756Ba + γ</code>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lesson 2: Investigating Principles Governing Motion</h2>
            <h3>What is It</h3>
            
            <h4>Galilean Conceptions vs. Aristotelian Conceptions</h4>
            <p>According to Aristotle, motion is classified as natural or violent motion. He explained that in a natural motion, a body will move and will return to its natural state based on the body’s nature and composition. In contrast, a body moving in a violent motion needs an external force for it to move. However, Galileo disproved Aristotle’s claims and stated that the motion of a body is not due to its composition. He further asserted that the motion of a body can be described by measurement and the changes in quantifiable variables such as time and distance. Lastly, he further asserted that:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A body who is in uniform motion will move a distance that is proportional to the time it will take to travel;</li>
                <li>A uniformly accelerating body will travel at a speed proportional to time;</li>
                <li>An object in motion will keep moving; and the external force is not necessary to maintain the motion.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>With regards to the concept of vertical motion, Aristotle pointed out that the velocity of a body is inversely proportional to the time it covers to travel a certain height. On the other hand, Galileo emphasized that if two objects of different weights are dropped from a high point, both will hit the ground at the same time.</p>

            <p>In terms of horizontal motion, Aristotle mentioned that bodies require force to maintain horizontal motion. In the contrary, Galileo asserted that if there is no interference, a body in motion will keep moving in a straight line forever. He further added that there is no need to apply force for it to continuously move. The external force will act upon the body not to keep it from moving, but for it to stop moving.</p>

            <p>Lastly, with regards to projectile motion, Aristotle coined the concept of antiperistasis which is the resistance of a medium in response to the movement of a body; while Galileo explained that projectiles follow a curved path with a horizontal and vertical component.</p>

            <h4>Galileo and his Uniform Acceleration</h4>
            <p>Galileo asserted using his cannonball experiment that when objects are dropped simultaneously at the same height, they will reach the ground at the same time regardless of mass, size, and air resistance. This experiment paved the way for the discovery of the principle of uniform acceleration.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, he noticed that falling objects increase their speed as they go down and he coined this change in speed as acceleration. His observations led to remarkable conclusions that regardless of the mass, size, and shape of an object, and air resistance, falling objects will always have uniform acceleration and that, force is not necessary to sustain the horizontal motion of a body. He further asserted that the speed of a body is directly proportional to the time it travels a path and that the distance covered by a moving body is directly proportional to the square of time interval which implies that the speed of a falling object does not depend on a body’s weight but on the time of fall. Lastly, using his inclined plane experiment and cannonball experiment, he came up with the following observations and conclusions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A body moving down an inclined plane increases its acceleration by the same value after every second.</li>
                <li>The maximum acceleration of a body is attained when the inclined plane is positioned vertically as if the body is falling.</li>
                <li>Using the law of parabolic fall, he concluded that bodies fall with constant acceleration on the surface and that gravity pulling all bodies downward is a constant force.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this regard, he found out that force is not necessary to sustain horizontal motion.</p>

            <h4>Galileo’s Assertion and Newton’s Laws of Motion</h4>
            <p>Galileo Galilei proposed the first accurate principle governing motion and masses in his experiments wherein, remarkable findings such as bodies accelerate at the same rate regardless of their respective masses and sizes and that force is not needed to sustain horizontal motion were emphasized. He stated that the mass of an object is proportional to its resistance to move and that force is not necessary to keep an object in motion. However, Sir Isaac Newton proposed Laws on Motion anchored on the findings of Galileo and expounded his assertions. In his first law of motion, he mentioned that an object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force and a body in motion will keep moving unless external force is acted upon it. Lastly, he stated that a body will only accelerate if an external force is acted upon it.</p>

            <p>Newton’s first law states that, if a body is at rest or in motion, it will remain at rest or keep in motion unless an external force is acted upon. This postulate is known as inertia which was proposed by Galileo in his experiment about horizontal motion wherein, he stated that a body requires an external force to move and that an external force must be acted upon for a body to rest. On the other hand, the second law states that the change in momentum of a body is equal to the magnitude and direction of force acting upon it. He further added that force is the product of the mass of an object and its acceleration. Lastly, the third law also known as the law of interaction states that when two bodies interact, both will apply equal amount of forces to one another in the opposite direction.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 3: Light - Reflection</h2>
            <h3>What is It</h3>
            
            <h4>Reflection of Light</h4>
            <p>What happens when light strikes a surface? Some of the light is reflected as evidenced by the laser activity while others are transmitted or absorbed. This behavior of light to bounce as it strikes a surface is called reflection, as a result, it enables us to see images being reflected from a surface. As the light approaches a reflecting surface, it obeys the Law of Reflection. It tells us that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.</p>

            <h4>Light-reflecting from a Surface</h4>
            <p>For you to fully understand the law of reflection, analyze Figure 2. It illustrates the incident ray as a light ray approaching the surface or mirror that creates an angle of incidence (i) with the Normal line (N) which is an imaginary line drawn perpendicularly from the point of incidence on the surface or mirror. On the other side of the Normal (N) line is the reflected ray that leaves the surface or mirror. The distance between the reflected ray and the Normal line is called the angle of reflection (r). Therefore, the normal (N) divides the incident ray and reflected ray into two equal angles. The incident rays, reflected rays, and the normal line all lie on the same plane.</p>

            <h4>Diffuse vs. Specular Reflection</h4>
            <p>Mirrors are typical examples of a reflecting surface. Mirrors have a very smooth surface that give individual rays of light in the same surface orientation. Thus, when you look into a mirror, you can see a clear image of yourself. However, mirrors are not the only type of material that demonstrates a reflection of light. Most of the objects around us do! As you read this module, light is reflected from the pages, allowing you to read the written information.</p>

            <p><strong>Diffuse and Specular Reflection</strong></p>
            <p>Smooth surface bounces light in one direction creating a clear and vivid reflection of the image which is called specular reflection. On the other hand, a rough surface reflects light in various directions due to the uneven orientation of the surface, which will result in a hazy or unclear image of the object.</p>

            <p>These two types of reflection have many practical applications, let us cite some common examples. Night driving on a wet asphalt road becomes difficult due to glare produced by headlights of incoming vehicles. This is because the rough surface was filled with rainwater making the surface smooth, instead of a diffuse reflection, a more concentrated beam of light produces specular reflection. In the same manner, photography also takes advantage of specular and diffuse reflection in taking images of a subject. A picture of a beautiful mountain being reflected in the calm and still water is a classic example.</p>
