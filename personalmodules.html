            <h1>Lesson 1: Knowing Oneself – Strengths and Limitations</h1>
        </header>

        <section class="content-15">
            <p>The activity in the previous part of this module enables you to express yourself by digging deeper into your own point of view on the things around you. Contrary to what you know that knowing yourself begins by understanding yourself alone, you should also understand that knowing others can pave the way for knowing yourself better as they say, no man is an island.</p>
            <p>In this module, you will get to understand some philosophies discussing the principles of knowing oneself and later have a clear perspective of your own personalities. Let's begin with defining Self-Development.</p>

            <h2>Self-Development</h2>
            <p>The stages of man have many broad aspects covering different developmental tasks and adjustments. As an adolescent, it is undeniable that during these years, you find it most important to know yourself deeper. You may find yourself asking "What do you really want?" or "Why do you really like doing these things or being with these people?"</p>
            <p>You may find it odd that you are starting to ask yourself questions, but you have to understand that you are not the only person who has experienced it. In other words, what you are experiencing is just normal. Now that you are in your middle or late adolescence, we can say that you may have discovered changes in your life or in your behavior or attitude that compel you to discover more.</p>

            <h3>Know Thyself</h3>
            <p>According to the philosophical point of view, “An unexamined life is not worth living,” this is one of the famous lines once uttered by one of the greatest philosophers of Ancient Greece, Socrates.</p>
            <p>“Know Thyself” is an old maxim that has been used in varied literature and consequently gained different meanings. Thomas Hobbes also discussed his own views about the maxim from which he used the phrase “read thyself” in his famous work The Leviathan. He stressed that an individual could learn more by studying others and that he/she can do this by engaging himself/herself in reading books. However, Hobbes emphasized that a person learns more by studying oneself.</p>

            <h2>Self-Concept</h2>
            <p>Self-concept is one’s abstract and general idea about oneself, particularly toward one's unique personality and his/her own perception about his/her set of values, points of view, and behavior. This theory began with Rene Descartes, the Father of Modern Philosophy, who proposed his theory that a person’s existence depends on his/her perception. Descartes stated that the mind is the seat of consciousness, meaning that it is in the mind that we know everything about ourselves like our identity, passion, interest, feelings, and/or intellect.</p>

            <h3>Sigmund Freud’s Theory</h3>
            <p>Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, proposed that there are three components of personality within us: the Id, Ego, and Superego. These components play a vital role in how we think of ourselves.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Id</strong>: Freud explained that man's personality is driven by the pleasure principle, meaning the nature of the Id is to satisfy man's desires without thinking much about the situation.</li>
                <li><strong>The Ego</strong>: This is the second component that is developed around the age of three. It operates according to reality, allowing the Id to work in proper and socially accepted ways.</li>
                <li><strong>The Superego</strong>: Freud believed this aspect of personality begins to manifest around the age of five. It holds our moral judgments, or our concept of right and wrong, which are acquired from family and society.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Lesson 2: Personal Development – Personal Relationships and Attraction</h1>

    <section class="content-15" style="color: black;">
        <p>The Merriam-Webster dictionary, collegiately defined attraction as: the action or power of evoking interest, pleasure, or liking for someone or something; and a quality or feature that evokes interest, liking, or desire.</p>
        <p>Having this definition, it could be said that attraction is a positive connection between two or more people that share something in common, like interests, likes/dislikes, or desires. Some qualities may catch your attention, and which could spark a certain kind of relationship.</p>
        <p>When you have a positive attitude or evaluation regarding a particular person in relation to different components, that is interpersonal attraction. For many, interpersonal attraction relates only between two people having an intimate and romantic relationship. However, it is not only limited to such since it may also transpire between friends, colleagues, family members, and others.</p>

        <h2>Key Components of Attraction</h2>
        <h3>Physical Attractiveness</h3>
        <p>Attractive people draw out a more positive first impression. Initially, people tend to be influenced by what they see. Even the younger ones prefer to look at faces those adults consider attractive rather than at opposite ones (Langlois, et.al. 1991). Our perception of beauty, though, differs from one another since it can be influenced by culture, educational background, social status, etc. Everyone has his/her idea of what or who is attractive based on physical appearance.</p>
        <p>Facial features like the shape and color of the eyes, the nose, the lips, and even the cheekbones and jaw have an impact when talking with another person or people; the built of the body, the color of the hair, the complexion, the smoothness of the skin, and the smile also may be considered with impact as these are the first things available elements presented even without interaction.</p>

        <h3>Similarity</h3>
        <p>When you are asked by your teacher to select a partner for an activity, who do you usually choose? Why? The common answer might be a friend who used to be with you, perhaps, because there is a connection between the two of you that you do not have with others. We can say that you are “on the same wavelength” that is why you find it easy to get along with him/her because you share the same interests and opinions.</p>
        <p>Many researches support that similarity causes attraction. Oftentimes, people classify other people based on information they already knew about them. That is social categorization, wherein, people mentally group others on where they belong and that with the same characteristics with them, like group age, religion, personality, attitude, social status, or education. Thus, this social categorization has a negative effect. When people rely too much on that mentality, it results to stereotyping, where someone is being judged by others only because they were part of a specific group they knew and not based on who he/she is.</p>

        <h3>Proximity</h3>
        <p>One of the important aspects of any relationship is distance. Proximity pertains to physical distance with other people and it is related to functional distance (how often people interact or communicate with each other). The more you encounter or interact with the person, the more you allow yourself to get to know him/her better which leads to a better relationship like friendship or intimate relationship. Most likely, the people always near you just like your classmate or neighbor have a big tendency to become your friend.</p>

        <h3>Reciprocity</h3>
        <p>We tend to get along with people or with someone whom we have the same feelings toward. It is called reciprocity. It is when feelings with someone are being reciprocated or returned in the same way as you do. According to Brannan and Mohr, authors of one of the modules in the book of "Together: The Science of Social Psychology", “Another way to think of it is that relationships are built on a give and take; if one side is not reciprocating, then the relationship is doomed”. These may happen in any relationship, with friends, classmates, family members, or romantic partners.</p>

        <h2>Love and Commitment</h2>
        <h3>Love</h3>
        <p>It appears that the word Love has many meanings. Some definitions in the Merriam-Webster dictionary are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>(a)</strong> strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties;</li>
            <li><strong>(b)</strong> attraction based on sexual desire: affection and tenderness felt by lovers;</li>
            <li><strong>(c)</strong> affection based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests;</li>
            <li>An assurance of affection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any discussion about love piques the curiosity and interest of young adults your age. It may differ depending on one’s experience and knowledge of love, though. Sometimes, it may affect the emotional and psychological being of a person, thus influencing his/her emotion toward another. This emotional bond depends on the presence or absence of support from others.</p>

        <h3>Commitment</h3>
        <p>Commitment refers to the feelings and actions that keep partners working together to maintain the relationship. A successful relationship is built upon understanding each other's needs and desires and investing time and effort to make things last. Commitment is a choice, a long and not an easy process that requires participation from both parties.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Rajiv Jhangiani and Dr. Hammond Tarry, “commitment refers to the feelings and action that keep partners working together to maintain the relationship.” Any relationship will last through the cooperation of both parties, without this, the relationship will not last and ends with breaking up.</p>

        <h1>Lesson 3: Developing the Whole Person</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="content-14" style="color: black;">
        <p>Who would be responsible for developing one’s personality?</p>
        <p>Every individual undergoes different phases of development that form his/her individuality. Our personality is a product of genetic response that we inherit from our parents and from the influence of our environment. This environment, shaped by the people around us, culture, and practices, continuously creates social interactions that build relationships. This interaction contributes to who we are today and how we choose and decide for ourselves. Personality development is a complex administration of thoughts, feelings, emotion, and behavior that influence personal judgment.</p>
        
        <p>As a child, you dream of a good and satisfying life when you grow up. Your family becomes your helping hand in nurturing, guiding, and educating yourself. When you reach adolescence, you experience drastic changes in your physical appearance, cognitive abilities, social relationships, and emotional behavior. At this stage, our environment becomes part of our development, from which we acquire knowledge and collect information to organize and interpret different life situations.</p>
        
        <h2>Erik Erikson's Psychosocial Development</h2>
        <p>According to Erik Erikson, adolescence is the stage of Psychosocial development known as “identity vs. role confusion.” This is the stage wherein teens need to develop a sense of self and personal identity. At this point, teenagers start to form a circle of friends in which they build trust.</p>
        
        <h3>Adolescence Cognitive Empathy</h3>
        <p>Teenagers also experience adolescence cognitive empathy, known as the “theory of mind,” which is described as having high regard for the perspective of others and feeling concern for them. As adolescents, they tend to foster social cooperation that prevents problems and leads to the avoidance of conflicts with peers. Teenagers are very careful in understanding the emotions of their friends as they start to create deep trust with them. Sometimes, this leads to misunderstandings with their family, the abuse of prohibited drugs, pre-marital sex, cigarette smoking, and alcohol intake. Based on research, teenagers are commonly high-risk takers and impulsive due to incomplete development of the frontal lobe during adolescence. The frontal lobe is responsible for judgment, impulse control, and planning. That is why they search for self-identity and independence, which requires guidance from their parents, relatives, and other people like teachers with whom they can share their struggles.</p>

        <p>These experiences and challenges are part of a process of personality development that adolescents need to understand. It is necessary for them to examine all the circumstances and opportunities so that they can deal with calm. They have to be open-minded to the opinions and advice of others in order to shape their future with a broader perspective and self-determination.</p>
        
        <h2>The Power of Thoughts, Feelings, and Actions</h2>
        <p>You cannot escape life challenges, so you should know how your thoughts, feelings, and actions in managing personal agency should be handled. As an adolescent, you should be accountable for all your actions because these power triads (thoughts, feelings, and actions) can either make or break your motivation to take charge of life. It is up to you how you will handle it. Remember, your judgment is based on your views in life, and it is rooted in your upbringing.</p>

        <p>Thoughts are impressions activated by a stimulus in your mind that is evident from the environment that you are in. These conscious thoughts occupy emotions that give life to thoughts, and they are expressed through feelings. Sometimes, when you are too emotional, you could not think properly because your emotions occupy your thoughts, meaning there is less space to analyze the situation because feelings occupy it. Behaviors are bodily reactions made based on our feelings, which result in actions.</p>
        
        <p>There are instances when feelings are faster than emotion and thought. This would result in a fast reaction and realizing the emotion and thought afterward. Either positive or negative, feelings result in actions. Emotions can direct and control thoughts, which sometimes affect your consciousness. This can also lead to a loss of focus. As a teenager, it is very important to be focused on your goals. A focused thought will lead to high intelligence. That is why if you are disturbed by your emotions, try to figure out where the emotion is coming from, and it will bring you back to reality.</p>

        <h3>Staying Focused and Regulated</h3>
        <p>Teenagers experience enjoyment and daunting times, but it is very important to stay focused so that they will lead you to the route of your goal. It is not easy to achieve the goal, but if you have self-regulation that will control your emotions, thoughts, and behavior, it will help you to be successful in life. Learning from mistakes and facing challenges with confidence and faith in God will give you the power to be successful in life.</p>
