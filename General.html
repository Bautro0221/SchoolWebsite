                <h2>Lesson 1: Representing Real-Life Situations Using Functions</h2>
                <h3>What’s In</h3>
                <p>Before we proceed in representing real-life scenarios using functions, let’s go back to where we started. What have you remembered about relations and functions?</p>
                <p><strong>A relation</strong> is any set of ordered pairs. The set of all first elements of the ordered pairs is called the domain of the relation, and the set of all second elements is called the range.</p>
                <p><strong>A function</strong> is a relation or rule of correspondence between two elements (domain and range) such that each element in the domain corresponds to exactly one element in the range.</p>
                <p>To further understand functions, let’s study the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A = {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5)}</li>
                    <li>B = {(3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)}</li>
                    <li>C = {(1,0), (0, 1), (-1,0), (0,-1)}</li>
                    <li>D = {(a,b), (b,c), (c,d), (a,d)}</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A relation between two sets of numbers can be illustrated by a graph in the Cartesian plane. A function passes the vertical line test. A graph of a relation is a function if any vertical line drawn passing through the graph intersects it at exactly one point.</p>
    
                <h3>What is It</h3>
                <p><strong>Functions as representations of real-life situations</strong></p>
                <p>The situations above all illustrate functions. The function rule in the first situation is the product price. The input (domain) is the money used by Mark combined with the selected button, while the output (range) is the product. This also shows a one-to-one correspondence where a specific amount corresponds to a specific product.</p>
                <p>The diameter-circumference relationship is also a function. The diameter is the input, while the circumference is the output. What’s the function rule? As they divide each circumference by its diameter, they would notice a constant ratio which is a rough approximation of pi.</p>
                <p>A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. This function was illustrated by the third situation where Margareth was being paid for her work. This could also illustrate a many-to-one relationship where the employees (domain), including Margareth, are receiving the same amount of salary (range).</p>
                <p>Lastly, the length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. This is what the group of students applied to measure the height of the Narra tree. The same function rule (ratio) by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input (the height of the large object) when we measure its shadow.</p>
                <p>All the given situations above can be illustrated using what we call a <strong>function machine</strong>.</p>
    
                <h3>The Function Machine</h3>
                <p>Functions can be illustrated as a machine where there is the input and the output. When you put an object into a machine, you expect a product as output after the process is done by the machine. For example, when you put an orange fruit into a juicer, you expect orange juice as the output, and not grape juice. Or you will never expect to have two kinds of juices - orange and grape.</p>
    
                <h3>Let’s try to create equations using the following situations:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Height as a function of age:</strong> If height (H) is a function of age (a), give a function H that can represent the height of a person at age a, if every year the height increases by 2 inches.
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Since every year the height increases by 2 inches, the height function is <strong>H(a) = 2 + a</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Distance as a function of time:</strong> If distance (D) is a function of time (t), give a function D that can represent the distance a car travels in t hours, if every hour the car travels 60 kilometers.
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Since every hour the car travels 60 kilometers, the distance function is <strong>D(t) = 60t</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Battery charge as a function of time:</strong> Give a function B that can represent the amount of battery charge of a cellular phone in h hours, if 12% of battery is lost every hour.
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Since every hour 12% of the battery is lost, the amount of battery function is <strong>B(h) = 100 - 12h</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Volume of a box:</strong> Squares of side x are cut from each corner of a 10 in x 8 in rectangle, so that its sides can be folded to make a box with no top. Define a function in terms of x that can represent the volume of the box.
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The length and width of the box are 10 - 2x and 8 - 2x, respectively. Its height is x. Thus, the volume of the box can be represented by the function:
                            <br><strong>V(x) = (10 - 2x)(8 - 2x)(x) = 80x - 36x² + 4x³</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Lesson 2: Interest, Maturity, Future, and Present Values in Simple Interest</h2>
                <h3>What is It</h3>
                <p>From the previous conversation, you can say that allowance is one of the sources of funds for ordinary students. A person may decide on what they want to do with their money. In the scenario, there are two kinds of students: one who saves to buy the things they want, and another who saves to invest for their future. In doing so, investing money in the bank earns interest. </p>
                <p>In computing simple interest and other related components, the formula is:</p>
                <p><strong>Simple Interest (Is) formula:</strong></p>
                <p>Is = P × r × t</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Is</strong> = Simple interest</li>
                    <li><strong>P</strong> = Principal (the amount invested or borrowed or present value)</li>
                    <li><strong>r</strong> = Simple interest rate</li>
                    <li><strong>t</strong> = Time or term in years</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The formula can be manipulated to obtain the following relationships:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Formula for finding the principal amount:</strong> <em>P = Is / (r × t)</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Formula for finding the rate:</strong> <em>r = Is / (P × t)</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Formula for finding the time:</strong> <em>t = Is / (P × r)</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>To find the maturity (future) value, you can use either of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>F = P + Is</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>F = P(1 + r × t)</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Let us take the following examples:</p>
    
                <h3>Example 1</h3>
                <p><strong>Given:</strong> P = ₱18,500, r = 0.03, t = 5 years</p>
                <p><strong>Find:</strong> Simple interest (Is)</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the formula for Simple Interest: Is = P × r × t</p>
                <p>Substitute the given values into the formula: Is = 18,500 × 0.03 × 5</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Is = ₱2,775</p>
                <p>Therefore, the simple interest is <strong>₱2,775</strong></p>
    
                <h3>Example 2</h3>
                <p><strong>Given:</strong> P = ₱20,000, Is = ₱4,000, t = 4 years</p>
                <p><strong>Find:</strong> The rate (r)</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the formula for finding the rate: r = Is / (P × t)</p>
                <p>Substitute the given values into the formula: r = 4,000 / (20,000 × 4)</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> r = 0.05 or 5%</p>
                <p>Therefore, the rate of interest is <strong>5%</strong>.</p>
    
                <h3>Example 3</h3>
                <p><strong>Given:</strong> P = ₱40,000, Is = ₱700, r = 7%</p>
                <p><strong>Find:</strong> Time (t)</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the formula for finding the time: t = Is / (P × r)</p>
                <p>Substitute the given values into the formula: t = 700 / (40,000 × 0.07)</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> t = 0.25 years or 3 months</p>
                <p>Therefore, the term or time in years is <strong>¼ year</strong> or <strong>3 months</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Lesson 3: Operations on Functions</h2>
                <h3>What is It</h3>
                <p>In the previous modules, you learned to represent real-life situations using functions and evaluate a function at a certain value. The scenario presented above is an example of real-world problems involving functions. This involves two functions representing the savings of two senior high school students. Below is the representation of two functions represented by a piggy bank:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Neah: 𝑓(𝑥) = 5𝑥 + 10</li>
                    <li>Neoh: 𝑔(𝑥) = 3𝑥 + 5</li>
                    <li>Combined: ℎ(𝑥) = 8𝑥 + 15</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Suppose that we combine the piggy banks of the two students, the resulting function is another piggy bank. It's just like adding two functions will result in another function.</p>
    
                <h3>Definition of Operations on Functions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sum:</strong> If f and g are functions, their sum is denoted by (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x).</li>
                    <li><strong>Difference:</strong> The difference of functions is denoted by (f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x).</li>
                    <li><strong>Product:</strong> The product of functions is denoted by (f • g)(x) = f(x) • g(x).</li>
                    <li><strong>Quotient:</strong> The quotient of functions is denoted by (f / g)(x) = f(x) / g(x), excluding values of x where g(x) = 0.</li>
                    <li><strong>Composite Function:</strong> The composite function is denoted by (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)).</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Example 1</h3>
                <p>Given the functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>f(x) = x + 5</li>
                    <li>g(x) = 2x - 1</li>
                    <li>h(x) = 2x² + 9x - 5</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Determine the following functions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>(f + g)(x):</strong> Find the sum of the functions f(x) and g(x).</li>
                    <li><strong>(f - g)(x):</strong> Find the difference of the functions f(x) and g(x).</li>
                    <li><strong>(f • g)(x):</strong> Find the product of the functions f(x) and g(x).</li>
                    <li><strong>(h / g)(x):</strong> Find the quotient of the functions h(x) and g(x).</li>
                    <li><strong>(f + g)(3):</strong> Find the sum of f(x) and g(x) at x = 3.</li>
                    <li><strong>(f - g)(3):</strong> Find the difference of f(x) and g(x) at x = 3.</li>
                    <li><strong>(f • g)(3):</strong> Find the product of f(x) and g(x) at x = 3.</li>
                    <li><strong>(h / g)(3):</strong> Find the quotient of h(x) and g(x) at x = 3.</li>
                </ol>
    
                <h3>Composition of Functions</h3>
                <p>In composition of functions, you will have a lot of substitutions. As learned in the previous lesson, to evaluate a function, you just substitute a certain number into the variable of the given function. Similarly, if a function is substituted into all variables in another function, you are performing a composition of functions to create another function. Some authors call this operation "function of functions."</p>
    
                <h3>Example 2</h3>
                <p>Given:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>f(x) = x² + 5x + 6</li>
                    <li>h(x) = x + 2</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Find the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>(f ∘ h)(x):</strong> Find the composite function (f ∘ h)(x).</li>
                    <li><strong>(f ∘ h)(4):</strong> Find the value of (f ∘ h)(x) at x = 4.</li>
                    <li><strong>(h ∘ f)(x):</strong> Find the composite function (h ∘ f)(x).</li>
                </ol>
    
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p><strong>a. (f ∘ h)(x) = f(h(x)):</strong> Definition of function composition:</p>
                <p>f(h(x)) = f(x + 2) (since h(x) = x + 2)</p>
                <p>f(x + 2) = (x + 2)² + 5(x + 2) + 6 (replace f(x) with x² + 5x + 6)</p>
                <p>= x² + 4x + 4 + 5x + 10 + 6 (perform operations)</p>
                <p>= x² + 9x + 20 (combine like terms)</p>
    
                <p><strong>b. (f ∘ h)(4):</strong> Substitute x = 4 into (f ∘ h)(x):</p>
                <p>f(h(4)) = f(4 + 2) = f(6)</p>
                <p>f(6) = 6² + 5(6) + 6 = 36 + 30 + 6 = 72</p>
                <p><strong>c. (h ∘ f)(x) = h(f(x)):</strong> Definition of function composition:</p>
                <p>h(f(x)) = h(x² + 5x + 6) (since f(x) = x² + 5x + 6)</p>
                <p>h(x² + 5x + 6) = (x² + 5x + 6) + 2</p>
                <p>h(f(x)) = x² + 5x + 8</p>
