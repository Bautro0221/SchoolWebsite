            <h2>What is Physical Activity?</h2>
            <p>Physical activity is any bodily movement created by skeletal muscles that require energy outflow. It involves alternating reduction and relaxation of the skeletal muscles, which results in a notable increase in energy used.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Going for a walk, bike ride, or run.</li>
                <li>Doing household chores (e.g., scrubbing the floor, fetching water).</li>
                <li>Taking the stairs instead of the elevator.</li>
                <li>Playing at the park or raking leaves.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Easy breathing due to improved respiration and blood circulation.</li>
                <li>Improved cardiac output from a stronger and more efficient heart.</li>
                <li>Improved vascular system, as veins and arteries become cleaner.</li>
                <li>Increased muscular strength and endurance.</li>
                <li>Improved flexibility and sensory skills like balance and movement.</li>

            <h2>Basic Terms in Fitness</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Fitness</span>: A condition where an individual has enough energy to avoid fatigue and enjoy life.</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Physical Fitness</span>: A state of health that enables the individual to perform well in sports, work, and daily activities.</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Health-Related Fitness</span>: The ability to become and stay physically healthy.</li>

        <section>
            <h2>Five Health-Related Fitness Components</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cardiovascular Fitness</strong>: Ability of the heart and circulatory system to supply oxygen to muscles for extended periods. Example: 1 km run, cycling.</li>
                <li><strong>Muscular Strength</strong>: The maximum force a muscle can exert against an opposing force. Example: Push-ups.</li>
                <li><strong>Muscular Endurance</strong>: Ability of muscles to sustain repeated contractions. Example: Partial curl-ups, planking.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Ability to move a body part through a full range of motion. Example: Sit-and-reach test.</li>
                <li><strong>Body Composition</strong>: The percentage of fat, bone, water, and muscle in the body. Example: BMI (Body Mass Index).</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
    
        <section>
            <h2>Example: BMI Calculation</h2>
            <p>BMI (Body Mass Index) is calculated using the formula:</p>
            <pre>BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m)<sup>2</sup></pre>
            <p>For example, a person weighing 70 kg with a height of 1.75 meters would have a BMI of:</p>
            <pre>BMI = 70 / (1.75<sup>2</sup>) = 22.86</pre>
            <p>This would classify the individual as having a normal weight according to BMI standards.</p>

            <h1>Lesson 2: Nature and Background of Badminton</h1>
        
            <section>
                <h2>What is Badminton?</h2>
                <p>Badminton is believed to have originated in India with its initial name “poona” during the 17th century. It was played by the English Army officers stationed in India and later brought to England in 1870 by the Duke of Beaufort. It was introduced in a place called Badminton, hence the name "The Game of Badminton," and became an Olympic sport in 1992.</p>
                <p>Today, badminton is governed by the rules of the Badminton World Federation (BWF). It is played on a netted court where players volley the shuttlecock using a racket. The objective is to score by landing the shuttlecock on the opponent's court. The game can be played in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles formats.</p>
                <h2>Equipment Used in Badminton</h2>
                <div class="equipment">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Badminton Racket</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Badminton Court & Net</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Shuttlecock</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h2>Badminton Gripping Techniques</h2>
                <p><strong>Forehand Grip:</strong> The thumb and pointing fingers wrap around the handle forming a letter "V," with the rest of the fingers spread supporting the bottom part of the handle.</p>
                <p><strong>Backhand Grip:</strong> To hit on the non-dominant side, the fingers move slightly, with the thumb pressing flat on the flat side of the handle while the other fingers are together.</p>
                <h2>Basic Badminton Strokes or Hits</h2>
                <div class="strokes">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clear:</strong> A stroke above the head, the shuttle travels up, aiming for the long service line. It gives time to return to base position.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lob:</strong> A stroke below the head at waist-level, the shuttle travels upwards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drop:</strong> A stroke above the head, the shuttle drops near the net, typically for placement purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Net Drop/Shot:</strong> A stroke below the head, the shuttle barely touches the net and lands near it, used for placement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drive:</strong> A stroke at head-level, the shuttle travels flat over the net.</li>
                        <li><strong>Smash:</strong> A powerful stroke above the head, the shuttle travels down with speed and power, one of the most powerful strokes in badminton.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h2>Serving in Badminton</h2>
                <p>Serving is how you start the rally. There are restrictions on serving to ensure fairness, such as serving with an underarm action and the shuttle being below your waist level.</p>
                <h3>How to Serve</h3>
                <p>The serve must be hit upwards with an underarm motion. The shuttle must be below the waist, which is defined as the lowest part of your ribcage.</p>
        
                <h3>Kinds of Serves</h3>
                <div class="serves">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High and Deep Serve:</strong> Hold the shuttlecock head facing down, swing the racket upwards, and flick your wrist to send the shuttle high.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low and Short Serve:</strong> Hold the feather of the shuttlecock downwards, flick the racket lightly with your thumb pushing forward to make the shuttle travel short.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drive or Flick Serve:</strong> A quick snap of the wrist in a backhand grip, sending the shuttle directly in front of the body to the receiver.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h2>Simple Safety Precautions</h2>
                <div class="safety">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do some warm-up and stretching exercises.</li>
                        <li>Wear proper attire.</li>
                        <li>Ensure there is enough space in the play area.</li>
                        <li>Do cool-down activities after playing.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Lesson 3: Volleyball</h2>
            <h3>What is It</h3>
            <p>Volleyball is a game played by two teams with six players on each team. It is considered one of the most popular team sports worldwide. The players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net.</p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in 1895. He was a physical director of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Morgan designed it as an indoor sport for businessmen because basketball was too vigorous for them. Initially called "mintonette," the name was changed to "Volleyball" after a professor noticed the volleying nature of the game.</p>

            <p>The sport quickly gained popularity across the United States and worldwide. It became part of international competition, with the first volleyball world championships held in 1949 for men, and 1952 for both men and women. Volleyball was also included in the Olympics in 1964.</p>

            <h3>Basic Volleyball Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 players per team (3 front row, 3 back row)</li>
                <li>Maximum of three hits per side</li>
                <li>Players cannot hit the ball twice in succession (except during a block)</li>
                <li>The ball may be played off the net during a volley or on a serve</li>
                <li>A ball is "in" if it hits the boundary line</li>
                <li>A ball is "out" if it hits certain areas (antennae, outside the court, net outside antennas, referee stand, etc.)</li>
                <li>Catching, holding, or throwing the ball is illegal</li>
                <li>If two or more players contact the ball at the same time, it counts as one play</li>
                <li>A player cannot block or attack a serve from inside the 10-foot line</li>
                <li>Front-line players can switch positions after the serve</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic Violations in Volleyball</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stepping on or across the service line when serving</li>
                <li>Failure to serve the ball over the net successfully</li>
                <li>Contacting the ball illegally (lifting, carrying, throwing, etc.)</li>
                <li>Touching the net with any part of the body while the ball is in play</li>
                <li>Blocking a ball when reaching over the net in certain conditions</li>
                <li>Crossing the court centerline with any part of your body</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic Skills in Volleyball</h3>
            <h4>Serving</h4>
            <p>Serving is used to put the ball in play by sending it over the net into the opponent’s court.</p>

            <h4>Passing</h4>
            <p>Passing is used to receive the ball from your opponents or to control the ball accurately.</p>

            <h4>Setting</h4>
            <p>Setting involves passing the ball overhead to an attacker after receiving a teammate's pass, typically using the finger pads at the forehead.</p>

            <h4>Attacking/Spiking</h4>
            <p>Attacking, or spiking, involves putting the ball into the opponent’s court by performing a quick approach and a strong arm swing.</p>

            <h4>Blocking</h4>
            <p>Blocking is used to stop the opponent’s attack from crossing the net. It is done by standing facing the net, ready to jump and deflect the ball back into the opponent’s court.</p>

            <h4>Digging</h4>
            <p>Digging is used to receive an opponent’s attack, usually by performing a forearm pass from a low ready position.</p>
