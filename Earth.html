          <h2>Lesson 1: Origin and Structure of the Earth - Planet Earth</h2>
          <h3>What is it</h3>
          
          <p>Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life and is the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface. These are reasons why planet Earth is unique:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>It has liquid water;</li>
              <li>Surface or lithosphere, which includes the crust and the upper mantle;</li>
              <li>It has an atmosphere that shelters it from the worst of the sun’s rays.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Earth is the only planet in the solar system that has a large amount of liquid water. About 70% of the surface of the Earth is covered by liquid or frozen water. Because of this, Earth is sometimes called the “blue planet.” Planet Earth is habitable because it has the right distance from the sun. It is kept warm by an insulating atmosphere, and it has the right chemical ingredients for life, including water and carbon. It can provide water, oxygen, useful biological products for humans, and has suitable weather and climate.</p>
          
          <h4>Similarities Between Earth, Venus, and Mars</h4>
          <p>Earth, Venus, and Mars may have similarities:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>They are all terrestrial planets, made of solid rocks and silicates;</li>
              <li>They all have an atmosphere;</li>
              <li>They all almost have the same time to rotate on their axes;</li>
              <li>Earth and Mars both have water;</li>
              <li>They all have carbon dioxide;</li>
              <li>They all have landforms.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Differences Between Earth, Venus, and Mars</h4>
          <p>Earth, Venus, and Mars also have differences:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Venus has no water;</li>
              <li>Venus and Mars don’t have oxygen;</li>
              <li>Earth has life forms.</li>
          </ul>

           <h2>Lesson 2: Unifying Themes in the Study of Life</h2>
           <h3>What It Is</h3>
           
           <p>The unifying theme connects the different subdisciplines that make biology a science. In addition, living organisms differ from non-living organisms in various aspects. What are these shared properties (of living organisms) that make something “alive”?</p>
           
           <h4>All levels of life have systems of related parts</h4>
           <ul>
               <li>A system is an organized group of interacting parts.</li>
               <li>A cell is a system of chemicals and processes. It is the basic unit of life.</li>
               <li>A body system includes organs that interact.</li>
               <li>An ecosystem includes living and non-living things that interact.</li>
           </ul>
           
           <h4>Structure and function are related in biology</h4>
           <ul>
               <li>Structure determines function.</li>
               <li>The structure is the shape of the object.</li>
               <li>The function is the object’s specific role.</li>
           </ul>
           
           <h4>Organisms must maintain homeostasis to survive in diverse environments</h4>
           <ul>
               <li>Homeostasis is the maintenance of constant internal conditions.</li>
               <li>All living organisms must live in a stable environment.</li>
           </ul>
           
           <h4>Evolution explains the unity and diversity of life</h4>
           <ul>
               <li>Evolution is the change in living things over time. The genetic makeup of a population of a species changes.</li>
               <li>It accounts for both the diversity and the unity of life.</li>
           </ul>
           
           <h4>Traits are being inherited and transferred</h4>
           <ul>
               <li>The continuity of life depends on the inheritance of biological information in the form of DNA molecules.</li>
               <li>The genetic information is encoded in the nucleotide sequences of the DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid).</li>
           </ul>
           
           <h4>Organisms reproduce</h4>
           <ul>
               <li>It is a necessary part of living; the process of making more of one’s own kind.</li>
           </ul>
           
           <h4>Organisms are interdependent with one another</h4>
           <ul>
               <li>Organisms have evolved to live and interact with other organisms.</li>
               <li>Ecology deals with the interactions of living organisms with one another and their environment.</li>
           </ul>
           
           <h4>Organisms acquire and process energy</h4>
           <ul>
               <li>Living organisms use a source of energy for their metabolic activities.</li>
               <li>Some living organisms capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy in food.</li>
               <li>Some living organisms use chemical energy stored in molecules obtained from food.</li>
           </ul>
           
           <h4>Additional Unifying Themes</h4>
           <p>In addition to the properties mentioned, the two additional unifying themes in the study of life include:</p>
           
           <h5>Scientific Inquiry</h5>
           <ul>
               <li>The process of science includes observation-based discovery and the testing of explanations through the hypothetic-deductive method.</li>
               <li>Scientific credibility depends on the repeatability of observation and experiments.</li>
           </ul>
           
           <h5>Science, Technology, and Society</h5>
           <ul>
               <li>Many technologies are goal-oriented applications of science.</li>
               <li>The relationships of science and technology to society are now more crucial to understand than ever before.</li>
           </ul>

        <h2>Lesson 3: Perpetuation of Life</h2>
        <h3>What It Is</h3>
        
        <h4>Asexual Reproduction</h4>
        <p>Asexual reproduction is defined as the formation of new individuals from the cells of a single parent. This is very common in plants and is less common in animals. Asexual reproduction does not involve the union of gametes (sperm cell and egg cell) and it does not change the number of chromosomes present. The resulting offspring is similar or identical to the parent, and without the need for a mate, they are able to reproduce. There are different types of asexual reproduction in animals.</p>
        
        <h4>Sexual Reproduction</h4>
        <p>Sexual reproduction is the perpetuation of a new organism from two organisms with the use of gametes. In this process, male gametes (sperm cell) fuse with a female gamete (egg cell) to form a diploid cell called a zygote containing two sets of chromosomes. During sexual reproduction, the genetic material contained in their chromosomes combines to produce genetically diverse offspring that are different from both parents. Most mammals and amphibians reproduce through the method of sexual reproduction.</p>
