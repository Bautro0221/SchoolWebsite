            <h2>Lesson 1: Discuss the Nature, Goals, and Perspective in/of Anthropology, Sociology, and Political Science</h2>
            
            <h3>What It Is</h3>
            <p>Cultural anthropologists study all aspects of culture, but what exactly is “culture”? When asked about introductory to cultural anthropology, students typically say that culture is food, clothing, religion, language, traditions, art, music, and so forth. Indeed, culture includes many of these observable characteristics, but culture is also something deeper. Culture is a powerful defining characteristic of human groups that shapes our perceptions, behaviors, and relationships.</p>
            
            <p>The English word 'Culture' is derived from the Latin expression 'clique or cultus,' meaning plowing, developing, refining, and love. In total, it implies developing and refining. Culture is a lifestyle. The food you eat, the garments you wear, the language you speak, and the God you worship are all parts of culture. In simple terms, culture is the epitome of how we think and do things. It encompasses the things we have acquired as citizens. All the accomplishments of people as members of groups can be considered culture. Art, music, literature, architecture, fashion, philosophy, religion, and science are examples of culture.</p>
            
            <p>Culture also includes traditions, customs, celebrations, ways of living, and one's attitude toward various issues of life. Thus, culture refers to a human-made environment, encompassing all the material and non-material products of group life that are transmitted from one generation to the next. There is general agreement among social scientists that culture consists of explicit and implicit patterns of behavior acquired by human beings. These are transmitted through symbols, constituting the distinctive achievements of human groups, including their embodiment as artifacts. The essential core of culture lies in those finer ideas transmitted within a group—both historically derived and selected with their attached values. More recently, culture is seen as historically transmitted patterns of meanings embodied in symbols, through which people communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and express their attitudes toward life.</p>

            <p>Moreover, culture is a declaration of our temperament in our ways of living and thinking. It can be seen in our literature, religious practices, entertainment, and happiness. Culture has two distinct segments: material and non-material. Material culture consists of objects related to the material part of our life, like our clothes, food, and household items. Non-material culture refers to ideas, standards, thoughts, and beliefs.</p>
            
            <p>Culture varies from one place to another and country to country. Its development depends on historical processes occurring in local, regional, or national settings. For example, we differ in how we greet others, our clothing, food habits, and social and religious traditions from those in the West. In general, the people of any country are defined by their particular cultural traditions.</p>

            <h4>TYPES OF CULTURE</h4>
            <h5>Material Culture</h5>
            <p>Examples include schools, materials, churches, temples, factories, and homes.</p>

            <h5>Non-Material Culture</h5>
            <p>Examples include symbols, language, values, and norms.</p>

            <h4>Anthropologist Philosophical Perspectives</h4>
            <p>Anthropologists have diverse views about culture. They have contributed thorough understanding and analysis, with these positions regarded as realistic, as culture is seen as an attribute of real individuals and societies that exist independently of the observed. Below are some insights from notable anthropologists:</p>

            <h5>Aspects of Culture</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Actions</strong> – e.g., regime, justice, organization, work, religion, techniques, science, art</li>
                <li><strong>Validity</strong> – e.g., values, opinions, laws, metaphors, meanings</li>
                <li><strong>Space</strong> – e.g., spatial experience, functional spaces, living space</li>
                <li><strong>Identity</strong> – e.g., self-consciousness, self-esteem</li>
                <li><strong>History</strong> – e.g., time experience, milestones, myths</li>
                <li><strong>Experience</strong> – e.g., rituals, customs, practices</li>
                <li><strong>Language</strong> – e.g., mother tongue, lingo, dialect</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Notable Anthropologists' Views on Culture</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Edward Burnett Tylor</strong>: "That complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."</li>
                <li><strong>Robert Ranulp Marrett</strong>: Defines culture in terms of “communicable intelligence,” “conventional understandings,” or “communicated ideas.”</li>
                <li><strong>Radcliffe Brown</strong>: Views culture as cultivation—the process of transmitting and acquiring traditions, which perpetuate society.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lesson 2: The Function of Education in Society</h2>
            
            <h3>What is It</h3>
            <p>The footprints of the education system of the Philippines can be traced from the countries that colonized it, namely Spain, America, and Japan. The education system was highly influenced by the years the Philippines was under these occupations. The most lasting and powerful change that occurred in the area of education was during the period of American occupation, where English was used as the primary language of instruction, and a system of public education was first established. (Education in the Philippines, n.d.)</p>
            
            <p>When the education system was established in the Philippines, schools provided learners with the opportunity to interact in groups, allowing them to become aware of their individual differences, gender roles, values, and capacities for growth and survival.</p>

            <h4>Formal Education in the Philippines</h4>
            <p>Formal education in the Philippines comprises institutions (schools) and trained teachers who facilitate the learning process. Previously, education in the Philippines spanned 14 years: 6 years in primary education, 4 years in secondary education, and 4 years in higher education leading to a bachelor’s degree. However, with the implementation of the K-12 program, the years spent in secondary education increased by two years, making it 16 years, plus the early entrance of 5-year-old students starting the K-12 program.</p>

            <p>The foundation policies of the K-12 program are found in the President’s Campaign’s 10-point Agenda for Education, the Social Contract with the Filipino People, which includes making education the central strategy for investing in people, reducing poverty, and building national competitiveness. The agenda also emphasizes becoming a trilingual country: learning English to connect to the world, learning Filipino to connect to the country, and retaining regional dialects to connect to cultural heritage. (Sarvi, 2015)</p>

            <p>The reason the medium of instruction in schools today is both in English and Filipino is due to these policies, with the use of local dialects particularly in primary education in the provinces.</p>

            <h4>Non-Formal Education in the Philippines</h4>
            <p>The Bureau of Continuing Education was created under the Education Act of 1982, Section 24, from the office of Nonformal Education. Under the Aquino government, the Bureau of Nonformal Education was created through Executive Order No. 117 in Article 14, Section 2(4) of the 1987 Philippine Constitution. This states: "The state shall encourage formal, indigenous learning systems, as well as self-learning, independent, and out-of-school study programs, particularly those that respond to community needs; and provide adult citizens, the disabled, and out-of-school youth training in civics, vocational efficiency, and other skills" (“Philippines Nonformal Education,” 2019).</p>

            <p>The creation of Non-Formal Education (NFE) led to the establishment of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), which promotes non-degree technical programs. TESDA is also responsible for skill orientation, training, and development for out-of-school youth and unemployed adults.</p>

            <p>Another form of non-formal education is the Alternative Learning System (ALS), which parallels formal instruction but is offered to students who could not complete basic education for various reasons. "The Governance Act for Basic Education, otherwise known as Republic Act 9155, stipulates the establishment of the Alternative Learning System (ALS) to provide out-of-school children, youth, and adult populations with basic education." (About Alternative Learning System, DepEd, n.d.)</p>

            <h4>Primary Functions of Education</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Develop a Productive Citizenry</strong> – Education greatly influences an individual to become a productive citizen. By attending school, learners become part of a community, which fosters lifelong learning and the development of values. A curriculum designed by the state shapes individual intelligence, teaching the value of liberty, democracy, and government authority. Education teaches individuals to do what is right and to be useful and concerned citizens.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote Self-Actualization</strong> – According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, self-actualization is achieved when a person realizes the importance of self-sacrifice, moving beyond personal needs to contribute to the community. Education helps individuals understand the value of self and the purpose of their existence. In the Philippines, one common value is the prestige of educational attainment, which brings pride to Filipino families when their children achieve higher education.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Education as a Basic Human Right</h4>
            <p>Education is widely recognized as a basic human right. While all nations agree that education is the solution to poverty, some individuals, particularly in conflict zones, may prioritize holding guns over pencils, thus setting aside education's role as a basic human right.</p>

            <p>In the Philippines, education has become a vital means for many deprived families to uplift their economic condition. However, the quality of education is often affected by societal problems, including worsening poverty and deteriorating family values.</p>

            <p>Despite these challenges, the Education for All movement led by UNESCO in 2015 strives to ensure that all children, particularly those in difficult circumstances or from ethnic minorities, have access to free, compulsory, and quality education.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 3: Social Inequalities</h2>
            
            <h3>What is It</h3>
            <p>Living in an unequal society causes stress and status anxiety, which may damage health. In more equal societies, people live longer, are less likely to be mentally ill or obese, and there are lower rates of infant mortality. Social inequality refers to relational processes in society that limit or harm a group's social status, class, and circle.</p>

            <p>The major examples of social inequality include gender inequality, healthcare, and social class. In healthcare, some individuals receive better and more professional care compared to others, and they are expected to pay more for these services.</p>

            <p>The Philippine government recognizes gender inequalities and is working to solve the problem. To address these issues, laws have been passed to ensure gender equality is properly addressed. Here are some examples:</p>

            <h4>Philippine Laws Addressing Gender Inequality</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R.A. 7610</strong>, also known as the "Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act."</li>
                <li>The Philippines enacted gender equality legislation after years of lobbying from female rights campaigners. In August 2009, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed the country's Magna Carta of Women in Manila, defining gender discrimination and outlining approaches to eliminate it.</li>
                <li>Other related laws passed by the Philippine legislature.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Allowing Top Government Positions to Be Handled by Women</h4>
            <p>Women nowadays are taking top positions in both private and government sectors. Notable examples include former Presidents Corazon Aquino and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, as well as former Supreme Court Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno. The Philippine government continues to encourage effective dialogue, a consultative process, and the strengthening of access to justice. This aims to bridge the cultural divide that gives rise to discrimination and exclusion, increasing the voice of indigenous people in decision-making.</p>

            <p>The equality of humanity has been a long-standing desire, dating back to ancient times. Humanity has wanted equal protection, equal rights, equality in wealth, and equality in life.</p>

            <h4>Factors Contributing to Social Inequality</h4>
            <p>The following factors contribute to social inequality:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Educational Attainment</strong> – Inequality in education is evident in many instances. The rich can access better education easily, while the poor struggle to earn their diplomas. Educational inequality refers to the unequal distribution of academic resources, and there is a need for policies that encourage educational attainment based on merit, not gender.</li>
                <li><strong>Wealth and Poverty</strong> – Social inequality is caused by the unequal distribution of wealth. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the advantages of the upper class and the struggles faced by the middle and lower classes. There is a huge difference in the allocation of wealth between the rich and the poor.</li>
                <li><strong>Power</strong> – Power in the context of social inequality refers to economic, cultural, and social positions. Power also involves reputation and a particular status in society.</li>
                <li><strong>Gender Inequality</strong> – Gender inequality acknowledges that men and women are not equal and that gender affects an individual's experiences. These differences arise from distinctions in biology, psychology, and cultural norms. Some distinctions are empirically grounded, while others are socially constructed. Studies show the different lived experiences of genders across domains such as education, life expectancy, personality, career, and politics. Gender inequality varies across cultures.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            <h4>Social Issues in the 21st Century</h4>
            <p>Social issues in contemporary times are crucial topics when discussing social inequality. Government programs and initiatives at local, national, and global levels continue to address these issues.</p>

            <h4>Types of Inequality</h4>
            <h5>Local Inequality</h5>
            <p>The current state of indigenous cultural communities involves ethnic groups that are often less fortunate, with their rights violated by wealthier individuals. An ethnic group is characterized by ascribed status, an organizational form, a sense of identity, and a subculture. Institutional completeness refers to the development of solidarity, ethnic identity, and institutions by an ethnic population.</p>

            <h5>National Inequality</h5>
            <p>Economic and political circumstances play a significant role in national inequality. Economic policy should reflect national interests and guide the future. When the national government fails to perform its duties effectively, the imbalance between the rich and the poor increases. If political policies do not consider national interests for all citizens, discrimination and inequality will arise.</p>

            <h5>Global Inequality</h5>
            <p>International inequality refers to the inequality between countries, and global inequality concerns the inequality between people across countries. This includes economic differences, as well as disparities in medical care and education.</p>

            <p>Inequality is not limited to societies and states; it also exists among states. Some states are wealthier and more powerful than others, and this often results in wealthier states becoming more influential in the global community. This creates a situation of global inequality, where poorer and less powerful states are controlled and influenced by richer, more powerful states.</p>
