            <h2>Lesson 1: Introduction to Media and Information Literacy</h2>
            <h3>What is It</h3>
            <p>Introduction to Media and Information Literacy involves necessary skills that let a person interact using different media platforms and get access to information around the globe. These should be learned because we are now living in the information age when the media have a significant role in our society towards disseminating information, connecting people, and acting as an agent of change in our society.</p>

            <h4>A. Communication and Media Information</h4>
            <p>Communication is affected by media and information because of the advancement of technology and the availability of different communication services. These allow us to have access to fast and easy forms of communication through the use of different media platforms and social media sites like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Twitter, among others. However, this form of communication may have a negative effect on people in terms of personal relationships that may be strained by the over-reliance on social media that are fertile grounds for fake news and hoaxes.</p>
            <p>Therefore, we should always be mindful in taking advantage of the use of communication technology in appropriate ways. We must keep in mind the principle of “Think before you click”.</p>

            <h4>B. Media Literacy, Information Literacy, and Technology Literacy</h4>
            <p>Media literacy highlights the capacity of an individual to understand the functions of media and determine the relevant use and worth of media platforms. This means that an individual knows how to use or manage media accounts or media platforms. Meanwhile, information literacy is the communication or acquiring of data or facts that relate to the use of media information. This involves a careful and thoughtful way of gathering information legally, avoiding such pitfalls as violating intellectual property rights and plagiarism. Technology literacy, on the other hand, is the skill of an individual to manipulate technology independently or with the assistance of others in using the technology in an efficient and suitable way. These skills are needed to access knowledge and communicate information in a legal and ethical manner.</p>
            <p>Information and media literacy enable people to become responsible users and producers of media and information.</p>

            <h4>C. Responsible Use of Media and Information</h4>
            <p>The 21st Century is known as the information age. Now, people are highly dependent on technology in different aspects of their lives such as for communication, entertainment, and work-related activities. Responsible use of media and information is encouraged especially in education. Teachers and students use reliable internet sources in acquiring information as well as in research. Others use different media platforms for information dissemination and for social awareness and advocacy purposes.</p>
            <p>The value of media information literacy is undeniable across all nationalities around the globe. For example, modern Good Samaritans use media platforms through various ways like video blogging to help people in need. These platforms also have economic value to their users. Media influencers who have gained many subscribers and followers are paid by YouTube through the advertisements and commercials inserted in their videos. Also, networking businesspersons and online sellers use different media platforms as an important tool to recruit members, advertise, and sell their products, respectively.</p>
            <p>Some social media are agents of change. Users who want to increase awareness or elicit public response to issues flock to social media where they can freely write their opinions, textually or through “memes,” on their advocacies. There is, at present, little guarantee on the truth of what is being shared, but people react to it, sometimes getting involved in conflicts online or offline. Therefore, social media users, especially influencers, must be responsible for what they post on their platforms. They have to make sure that the information they share is factual and comes from reliable sources.</p>
            <p>The ease of getting information via media also has its disadvantage: the risk of invasion of privacy. Many users are unaware that their personal information can also be taken from their media accounts without their knowledge, resulting in effects ranging from annoyance due to too many targeted ads to legal problems from identity theft.</p>
            <p>Certainly, media and information literacy is an essential skill that we need to develop for us to take advantage of the use and benefits of technology in modern society, while avoiding its pitfalls.</p>

            <h4>Tips for the Responsible Use of Media and Information</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ensure personal information safety:</strong> Do not display or give away your personal information on your social media account. When using applications and websites, read the “terms of use” carefully.</li>
                <li><strong>Get permission:</strong> When posting videos or pictures of other people on your social media account, ask for the owner's approval and of the people who appeared in the video or picture.</li>
                <li><strong>Think before you click:</strong> When posting or sharing on social media, think first if the information you are going to post or share is accurate, helpful, informative, nice, and kind to others. Avoid posting or sharing inappropriate, uncomfortable, or rude insights.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep your password safe:</strong> Keep an eye on your account; do not let others know your password. Update your password often to avoid your account from being hacked or used by a poser.</li>
                <li><strong>Spread positivity:</strong> Share positive and uplifting posts to your friends. As much as possible, avoid negativity and hate in your account because what you post on social media becomes a reflection of yourself.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Lesson 2: The Evolution of Traditional to New Media</h2>
            <h3>What is It</h3>
            <p>The term “media” is described as means of communication for people which includes newspapers, radio, televisions, and the internet. In the advent of the “new normal”, the role of media has been highlighted more than ever. The society relies heavily on media and information technology, not only for communication but also for information dissemination, distance learning, work at home, etc. With the attainment of technological advancement, people wondered how media changes throughout time and what forms of media exist in different ages. To answer these queries, let us now discover how media have evolved from the pre-industrial age to the information age.</p>

            <h4>Pre-Industrial Age (Before 1700s)</h4>
            <p>During pre-industrial age, about 4.5 million years ago, the early hominids discovered fire, developed paper from plants, and built weapons. The prehistoric inhabitants used stone tools and metals as part of their daily activities like hunting and gathering. They also used crude stone tools to create things considered rock art. These prehistoric arts such as petroglyphs and pictographs were considered the earliest forms of traditional media.</p>

            <h4>Industrial Age (1700s - 1930s)</h4>
            <p>The industrial age occurred during the industrial revolution in Great Britain. This period brought in economic and societal changes, such as the substitution of handy tools with machines like the power loom and the steam engine. The transformation of the manufacturing industry and commercial enterprise for mass production of various products occurred. Also, long-distance communication became possible via telegraph, a system used for transmitting messages.</p>

            <h4>Electronic Age (1930s - 1980s)</h4>
            <p>The electronic age started when people utilized the power of electricity that made electronic devices like transistor radios and televisions work. The creation of the transistor piloted the rise of the electronic age. The power of transistors was used in radio, electronic circuits, and early computers. In this period, people made use of air access to communication.</p>

            <h4>Information Age (1900s - 2000s)</h4>
            <p>The information age, also known as the digital age, signified the use of the worldwide web through an internet connection. Communication became faster and easier with the use of social networks or social media platforms such as Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Twitter, among others. The rapid technological advancement and innovation with the use of microelectronics led to the development of laptops, netbooks, mobile phones, and wearable technology.</p>

            <h3>The Influence of Media on the Values and Norms of People</h3>
            <p>Norms are standards of behavior that are expected in a society based on their customary laws or conduct. These norms entail conformist behavior following social standards like respect for elders, obtaining education, getting married, and gender roles. The set of norms begins at home and continues to develop as we expand ourselves to the social world. With the use of social media, people are no longer limited to his/her social group and become more readily connected to global society with diverse values and norms.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 3: Types of Media</h2>
            <h3>What is It</h3>
            
            <h4>Print Media</h4>
            <p>This type of media uses paper and ink that is reproduced in a printing process traditionally mechanical, such as books, newspapers, magazines, journals, newsletters, and brochures. Print media may include text, graphics, or a combination of both.</p>

            <h5>Text Media</h5>
            <p>A type of print media that is a simple and flexible format for conveying ideas, whether handwritten or printed. Not all text media are print media. Text media may also be displayed on-screen as part of broadcast media, multimedia, or new media. An important feature of text media is <strong>typography</strong>, which is the art and technique of arranging the visual component of the written word. It features textual designs with optical illusions that improve readability and help convey meaning. Fonts and alignment are parts of typography.</p>

            <h5>Visual Media</h5>
            <p>A type of print media that refers to pictures, photos, images, and graphics used to channel communication using the sense of sight. Visuals combined with text are also considered as visual media. Like text media, visual media are not limited to print media. “Visual media” is a general term for any medium that mainly makes use of sight as a channel to receive the message. An important feature of visual media, in print or elsewhere, is <strong>graphic design</strong>, which is the process of visual communication that organizes and presents information developed through a creative process for a particular purpose. Graphic design is part of daily life, from things like candy wrappers to billboards and even T-shirts. Graphic designs inform, persuade, organize, stimulate, locate, identify, attract attention, and provide pleasure.</p>

            <h5>Examples of Visual Media</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Informational Graphics (Infographic)</strong> – A visual representation of information to understand high-volume and complex data easily, e.g., graphs, charts.</li>
                <li><strong>Cartoons</strong> – A sketch or drawing intended as satire, caricature, or humor, e.g., comic strips, editorial cartoons in newspapers and magazines.</li>
                <li><strong>Photography</strong> – A photograph is an image created by light captured on a light-sensitive surface, which is usually photographic film. Digital photography via digital cameras and cellular phones has made taking photographs easier and less expensive.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Broadcast Media</h4>
            <p>Broadcast media is a type of media that reaches target audiences using airwaves as the transmission medium. Examples of broadcast media are radio and television.</p>

            <h5>Audio Media</h5>
            <p>A type of broadcast media that uses audio or voice recording as a medium in the delivery of information. These are devices that appeal to the auditory sense.</p>

            <h5>Multimedia</h5>
            <p>Multimedia is a type of broadcast media concerned with the computer-controlled integration of text, graphics, drawings, still and moving images (video), animation, audio, and any other media where every type of information can be stored, communicated, and handled digitally. Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with, or accessed by information-processing devices such as high-tech and automated devices, but can also be part of a live presentation. Multimedia devices are electronic media equipment used to store and play or display multimedia content. In the early years of multimedia, "rich media," a term with a similar concept, was used in advertising. “Hypermedia” is an extension of multimedia, where photos or graphics are linked to other sources of information.</p>

            <h4>New Media</h4>
            <p>New media is a term used to integrate different technologies emerging on one digital platform to organize and distribute content. Some examples are podcasts, augmented reality, video games, blogs, and wikis. There are two common characteristics of new media: disseminating information to several receivers which is theoretically infinite, in customized ways, depending on the specification for endorsed categories.</p>

            <h4>Media Convergence</h4>
            <p>Media convergence refers to the merging of different equipment and tools for producing and distributing news through digitization and computer networking. It allows media texts to be produced and distributed on multiple media devices. This is also known as technological convergence. Media convergence is the synergy of communication, computing, and content in the digital world. A smartphone that has a camera, radio, web browser, video, etc., is an example of converged media.</p>
