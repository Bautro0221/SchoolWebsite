            <strong>Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN)</strong>
            is a four-year degree program in the Philippines that revolves around caring for the sick or injured. This does not only involve addressing immediate threats to the patient’s health, but also guiding the patient all the way through physical, mental, and emotional recovery.

            As a nursing student you will be trained to conduct health assessments, provide patients with preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care, perform life-saving interventions, respond to disaster and emergency situations, and keep medical documentations.
