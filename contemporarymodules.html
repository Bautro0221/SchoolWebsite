            <h2>Lesson1: Arts in the Philippines</h2>
            <p>The development of Philippine arts is shaped by three major traditions: the Ethnic Tradition, the Spanish Colonial Tradition, and the American Colonial and Contemporary Arts Traditions. Even before colonization, the Philippines had its indigenous arts influenced by the geographical location of its ancestors. The arrival of the Spaniards replaced some of these indigenous arts with Western influences. During the Spanish rule, art forms were influenced by religion and secularization. After the Spanish era, the Americans introduced modern art during their rule. This led to the continuous development of art through urbanization, consumerism, and new technology, which shaped contemporary art.</p>
            
            <h3>Ethnic Tradition</h3>
            <p>Art forms in this period were influenced by geographical location and the everyday lives of the Filipinos. Arts reflected pagan beliefs, daily activities such as fishing and farming, and specific decorative patterns in communities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Angono Petroglyphs:</strong> Located in Binangonan, Rizal, these petroglyphs were discovered by National Artist Carlos "Botong" Francisco in 1965. The 127 human and animal figures are dated to the late Neolithic period.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Spanish Colonial Tradition</h3>
            <p>During the Spanish colonial era, art was used to propagate the Catholic faith and was heavily influenced by religion and secularization.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 2: Art: Meaning and Forms</h2>
            <h3>What is It?</h3>
            <p>The pictures presented in the previous activity are depictions of the artworks that are seen today. Present-day art has a lot of variety. There are various expressions of Philippine art that can be found right inside our homes and are found everywhere. The arrangement of furniture, home décor, the way a mother cooks a particular kind of food, jeepney designs and signages, architecture of buildings, billboard designs, and other unnoticed works of art comprise the “art of today.”</p>
            <p>The artworks and styles of the past have evolved and adapted to a dynamic changing world, a world immersed in the latest technology and emerging ideologies. These artworks and styles are created, witnessed, and experienced in our lifetime by artists and style experts catering to Millennial and Gen Z viewers and tech-savvy clientele. These artworks are collectively known as Contemporary Art.</p>
            <p>The term contemporary has been defined as something “happening, existing, living, or coming into being during the same period of time” (Merriam-Webster). Assuming this definition, Contemporary Art refers to art of any form and genre that is produced in our contemporary time, simply put as “art created today.” It should not be confused with Modern Art, which ranges from the end of the 19th Century until the 1970s or 1980s or the late 20th Century. This places Contemporary Art from the late 20th Century to the present. Modern Art differs from Contemporary Art historically and contextually.</p>

            <h3>Contemporary Art</h3>
            <p>Contemporary Art is influenced by the economic, social, political, and environmental context where the artist is immersed in. It can be said that Contemporary Art is the artist’s expression of his perception and comprehension of these contexts. Contemporary Arts in the Philippines is as diverse as our people. Contemporary Philippine Art is not confined to the usual genres of the four main art forms, namely, visual, literary, applied, and performing arts. Genres are categories of artistic creation and are characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter. Many other genres came up, which include pure art forms as well as mixed art forms.</p>

            <h3>Elements of Contemporary Art</h3>
            <p>Contemporary Arts have different elements that are put together to create a distinct artwork. These elements include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appropriation:</strong> This relates to the modifications made by the artist.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybridity:</strong> This refers to the use of different art mediums that are put together.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Its application highlights the creativity of the artist.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Carried out for viewers to experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Space:</strong> Intricate use of space.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These elements are combined in different ways to come up with Integrative Art. Integrative Art employs the use of different art elements used together in distinct expressions. Thus, it becomes a combination of different art forms for specific groups of viewers. Integrative art is also a fusion of different art disciplines using different styles and media in creating art. It can be found in different places of the country, usually in urban areas where artists have ready access to different art forms and media. Examples of Integrative Art include the use of computer applications combined with other media and the use of non-traditional art materials in creating artworks usually done with mixed art forms.</p>

            <h3>Contemporary Art Forms from the Philippine Regions</h3>
            <p>With modern technology and easy access to far-flung areas of the country, many artworks have become known, and many more are being created by present-day artists from the different regions. All forms of art can be found throughout the country. Artworks coming from the seventeen regions of the three main island groups of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao have been exhibited in different exhibition halls and museums. Viewers have come to know and, more importantly, understand the present-day art expressions of artists who want their culture, situation, and issues to be known through their artworks.</p>

            <h3>Distinct Features of Contemporary Philippine Art</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Communal nature:</strong> Reflects the relationships built around the bonds of community and society.</li>
                <li><strong>Intuitive:</strong> Filipinos are immersed in their consciousness of themselves, their community, and their culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Holistic:</strong> Individuals, groups of people, and events are perceived in their entirety, as well as the unitive use of art materials and forms.</li>
                <li><strong>Creative process:</strong> The artist puts more emphasis on how their artwork was made than on the artwork itself.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrative:</strong> It encompasses religious, moral, spiritual, social, and environmental concerns.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-focal:</strong> Considers everything and everyone, the wide perspective of the artwork as well as both artist and viewer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lesson 3: Contemporary Art Forms from the Regions</h2>
            <h3>What is It</h3>
            <p>From the previous lessons, did you wonder what are the classifications of contemporary arts? Or what are the various art forms known from different regions specifically from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao? Those questions will be answered and explored in this module.</p>
            <p>The Philippine Contemporary Art can be classified into seven major art forms. These are painting, sculpture, architecture, film, literature, music and theater, and dance. Knowing these classifications will guide us in identifying and exploring different contemporary art forms from the regions of the Philippines. So, let’s start classifying and exploring the Philippine’s contemporary art forms!</p>

            <h3>PHILIPPINE CONTEMPORARY ARTS</h3>
            <p>Philippine contemporary arts can be described into visual arts, literary arts, and performing arts. Visual art is an expression of artistic ideas through images, structures, and tactile work. Some visual artworks are integrated, meaning it combines several mediums to create new and unique artwork. Painting, sculpture, architecture, and film are examples of visual arts.</p>

            <h4>Painting</h4>
            <p>Painting is the expression of ideas and emotions through the creation of aesthetic qualities in a two-dimensional visual language. The elements of this language—shapes, lines, colors, tones, and textures—are used to produce sensations of volume, space, movement, and light on a flat surface. The first paintings in the Philippines were commissioned works during Spanish colonization. Below are some paintings from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.</p>

            <h4>Sculpture</h4>
            <p>Sculpture is an art form in which hard or plastic materials are worked into three-dimensional art objects. Filipino sculptors became known in the middle of the 19th century. Here are some sculptures in the Philippines.</p>

            <h4>Architecture</h4>
            <p>Architecture is the art and practice of designing and constructing buildings. Philippine architecture was characterized as simple, rational, and functional. In the 20th century, young Filipinos who studied in American colleges introduced the neoclassic style in building structures. After World War II, real estate development began. Below are some examples of architectural designs from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.</p>

            <h4>Film</h4>
            <p>Film is a form of visual art used to imitate experiences and communicate ideas, stories, or feelings with moving images. The film industry in the Philippines began in 1897. In contemporary periods, typical themes of Philippine films include martyr wives, superheroes, action, melodramas, and comedies.</p>

            <h4>Dance</h4>
            <p>Dance is the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music, within a given space, to express an idea or emotion, release energy, or simply delight in the movement itself. Dances in the Philippines vary from region to region, and below are some of the dances from different regions.</p>
