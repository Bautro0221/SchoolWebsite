            <h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2>
            <h3>The Process of Doing Philosophy</h3>
            <p>In few years, you will gain new experiences in life that you may have never dreamed of. Such experiences may excite or challenge you, while some can make you rethink your life and decisions.</p>

            <h3>What is Philosophy?</h3>
            <p>Is it a way of life? Why or why not?</p>
            <p>How do you apply it in everyday life?</p>
            <p>We will find out the answers in this lesson.</p>

            <h3>Learn About It!</h3>
            <p>Doing philosophy helps you think many things, including those that leave you confused or without an acceptable answer.</p>

            <h3>The Meaning of Philosophy and Philosophy of the Human Person</h3>
            <p>Philosophy meaning "love of wisdom," is a science where reason and logic are used to understand reality and answer questions of knowledge, morality and human nature. It can be described as either a body of knowledge or an intellectual activity.</p>

            <p><strong>As a body of knowledge</strong>, it provides methodologies and insights on how societal questions, such as moral dilemmas of euthanasia or same-sex marriage, can be answered.</p>

            <p><strong>As an intellectual activity</strong>, it is an analytic procedure of addressing individual thought processes such as resolving conflict and confusion, testing positions, and analyzing beliefs. In all instances, doing philosophy is prescribed by logic, reason, and ethics leading to wisdom.</p>

            <p>It is also known as "philosophy in life." This concept is important because it serves as the guiding principle on how one ought to live life.</p>

            <p>Philosophy of Human Person can be defined as the science of human beings which interprets the data of experience in the light of metaphysical principles. It has two sources, namely, the data of experience supplied mainly by everyday experience, which is confirmed by experimental sciences, and the metaphysical principles supplied by ontology or by metaphysics. Thus Philosophy of Human Person is a combination of science and metaphysics.</p>

            <p>Again, we can consider Philosophy of Human Person as that branch of philosophy which concerns itself with trying to respond to those deepest and perennial questions about human beings questions that have plagued humans ever since history began. Here, our attempt is to respond to these issues, and not answer them. For, the word 'answer' seems to imply more or less complete and thorough rejoinder to the matter, an exhaustive conclusion 'once-and-for-all.' But we must remember that we are dealing with human being who is a mystery to be understood more and more than a problem to be solved once and for all. We cannot demand a conclusive, authoritative answer but only a response.</p>

            <h3>Importance of Philosophy of Human Person</h3>
            <p>Philosophy of Human Person forms an important treatise in the study of Philosophy.</p>

            <p>After all, human existence is an inescapable part of philosophic thought. Almost everyone has been puzzled from time to time by such essentially philosophic questions as "What does life mean?" "Did I have any existence before I was born?" and "Is there life after death?" Most people also have some kind of philosophy in the sense of a personal outlook on life. Even a person who claims that considering philosophic questions is a waste of time is expressing what is important, worthwhile, or valuable. A rejection of all philosophy is in itself philosophy.</p>

            <p>By studying Philosophy of Human Person, people can clarify what they believe, and they can be stimulated to think about ultimate questions. A person can study philosophers of the past to discover why they thought as they did and what value their thoughts may have in one's own life. Philosophy has had enormous influence on our everyday lives. The very language we speak uses classifications derived from philosophy. For example, the classifications of noun and verb involve the philosophic idea that there is a difference between things and actions. If we ask what the difference is, we are starting a philosophic inquiry.</p>

            <h3>Importance of Philosophical Reflection</h3>
            <p>Philosophical reflection is the process by which a person undergoes a reflective state or evaluates his or her experiences first before making any related action. It is important as it enables thought to be looked into using a deeper, holistic perspective. In effect, actions are directed towards greater sources of wisdom and truth.</p>
