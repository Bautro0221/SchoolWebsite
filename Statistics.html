            <h2>Lesson 1: Testing Hypothesis</h2>
            <h3>What It Is</h3>
            <p>Hypothesis testing is a statistical method applied in making decisions using experimental data. Hypothesis testing is basically testing an assumption that we make about a population.</p>
            <p>A hypothesis is a proposed explanation, assertion, or assumption about a population parameter or about the distribution of a random variable.</p>
            
            <h4>Examples of questions you can answer with a hypothesis test:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Does the mean height of Grade 12 students differ from 66 inches?</li>
                <li>Do male and female Grade 7 and Grade 12 students differ in height on average?</li>
                <li>Is the proportion of senior male students' height significantly higher than that of senior female students?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Terms and Concepts Used in Test Hypothesis</h3>
            
            <h4>The Null and Alternative Hypothesis</h4>
            <p><strong>The null hypothesis</strong> is an initial claim based on previous analyses, which the researcher tries to disprove, reject, or nullify. It shows no significant difference between two parameters. It is denoted by 𝐻₀.</p>
            <p><strong>The alternative hypothesis</strong> is contrary to the null hypothesis, which shows that observations are the result of a real effect. It is denoted by 𝐻ₐ.</p>
            
            <h4>Level of Significance</h4>
            <p><strong>The level of significance</strong> denoted by alpha or 𝛂 refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null hypothesis.</p>
            <p>100% accuracy is not possible in accepting or rejecting a hypothesis.</p>
            <p>The significance level α is also the probability of making the wrong decision when the null hypothesis is true.</p>

            <h4>Two-Tailed Test vs One-Tailed Test</h4>
            <p>When the alternative hypothesis is two-sided like 𝐻ₐ: 𝜇 ≠ 𝜇₀, it is called <strong>two-tailed test</strong>.</p>
            <p>When the given statistics hypothesis assumes a less than or greater than value, it is called <strong>one-tailed test</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Illustration of the Rejection Region</h4>
            <p><strong>The rejection region</strong> (or critical region) is the set of all values of the test statistic that causes us to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
            <p><strong>The non-rejection region</strong> (or acceptance region) is the set of all values of the test statistic that causes us to fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
            <p><strong>The critical value</strong> is a point (boundary) on the test distribution that is compared to the test statistic to determine if the null hypothesis would be rejected.</p>

            <h4>Type I and Type II Errors</h4>
            <p><strong>Rejecting the null hypothesis</strong> when it is true is called a Type I error with probability denoted by alpha (𝛂). In hypothesis testing, the normal curve that shows the critical region is called the alpha region.</p>
            <p><strong>Accepting the null hypothesis</strong> when it is false is called a Type II error with probability denoted by beta (𝛃). In hypothesis testing, the normal curve that shows the acceptance region is called the beta region.</p>
            <p>The larger the value of alpha, the smaller is the value of beta.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 2: Identifying Parameters for Testing in Given Real-Life Problems</h2>
            <h3>What It Is</h3>
            <p>Parameters in statistics are an important component of any statistical analysis. In simple words, a parameter is any numerical quantity that characterizes a given population or some of its aspects. This means the parameter tells us something about the whole population.</p>
            <p>However, the numerical measure that is calculated from the sample is called a <strong>statistic</strong>. Statistic is a known number and a variable that depends on the portion of the population.</p>
            <p>A parameter denotes the true value that would be obtained if a census rather than a sample was undertaken.</p>

            <h4>Examples of Parameters</h4>
            <p>Examples of parameters are the measures of central tendency. These tell us how the data behave on an average basis. For example, mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency that give us an idea about where the data concentrate. Meanwhile, standard deviation tells us how the data are spread from the central tendency, i.e. whether the distribution is wide or narrow. Such parameters are often very useful in analysis.</p>

            <h4>In the normal distribution, there are two parameters that can characterize a distribution - the mean and standard deviation. By varying these two parameters, you can get different kinds of normal distribution.</h4>

            <h3>Identifying Parameter to be Tested</h3>
            
            <h4>Illustrative Examples:</h4>
            
            <ol>
                <li>The average height of adult Filipinos 20 years and older is 163 cm for males.
                    <br><strong>Parameter:</strong> the average height of adult Filipinos 20 years and older. <br>
                    In hypothesis testing, the parameter will be translated into symbols such as <strong>𝛍 = 163</strong> where 𝛍 is the symbol for mean/average and 163 is the value that pertains to the average height.
                </li>
                <li>A Grade 11 researcher reported that the average allowance of Senior High School students is ₱100. A sample of 40 students has mean allowance of ₱120. At 𝛼 = 0.01 test, it was claimed that the students had allowance of ₱100. The standard deviation of the population is ₱50.
                    <br><strong>Parameters:</strong> the average allowance of Senior High School students is ₱100 or <strong>𝝁 = ₱100</strong>.

            <h2>Lesson 3: Identifying Appropriate Test Statistics Involving Population Mean</h2>
            <h3>What Is It</h3>
            <p>Before we move forward to the different test statistics, it is important to define the following terms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A population</strong> includes all of the elements from a set of data.</li>
                <li><strong>A sample</strong> consists of one or more observations drawn from the population.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample mean (𝒙̅)</strong> is the mean of sample values collected.</li>
                <li><strong>Population mean (µ)</strong> is the mean of all the values in the population.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the sample is randomly selected and sample size is large, then the sample mean would be a good estimate of the population mean.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Population standard deviation (𝝈)</strong> is a parameter which is a measure of variability with fixed value calculated from every individual in the population.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample standard deviation (𝒔)</strong> is a statistic which means that this measure of variability is calculated from only some of the individuals in a population.</li>
                <li><strong>Population variance (𝝈²)</strong> indicates how the population data points are spread out. It is the average of the distances from each data point in the population to the mean, squared.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A test statistic is a random variable that is calculated from sample data and used in a hypothesis test. You can use test statistics to determine whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis. The test statistic compares your data with what is expected under the null hypothesis.</p>
            <p>To identify the test statistic, you must consider whether the population standard deviation/variance is known or unknown. If the population standard deviation (𝝈) is known, then the mean has a normal distribution. Use <strong>z-test</strong>. If the population standard deviation (𝝈) is unknown, then the mean has a t-distribution. Use <strong>t-test</strong>. Instead of the population standard deviation, use the sample standard deviation.</p>

            <h3>z-test</h3>
            <p>In a z-test, the sample is assumed to be normally distributed. A z-score is calculated with population parameters such as “population mean” and “population standard deviation”. It is used to validate a hypothesis that the sample drawn belongs to the same population. When the variance is known and either the distribution is normal or sample size is large, use a z-test statistic.</p>

            <h3>t-test</h3>
            <p>Like a z-test, a t-test also assumes a normal distribution of the sample. A t-test is used when the population variance or standard deviation are not known. When the variance is unknown and a sample size is less than 30, use a t-test statistic assuming that the population is normal or approximately normal.</p>

            <h3>Central Limit Theorem</h3>
            <p>In Central Limit Theorem, if the population is normally distributed or the sample size is large and the true population mean (µ) = µₒ, then z has a standard normal distribution.</p>
            <p>When population standard deviation (𝝈) is not known, we may still use z-score by replacing the population standard deviation (𝝈) by its estimate, sample standard deviation (s). Since the sample is large the resulting test statistic still has a distribution that is approximately standard normal.</p>
            <p>Historically, this was very useful, as most statisticians before did not have access to the t-table of quantities for very large number of degrees of freedom. But with modern computers today, using t-test with a very large sample size is not a problem at all. However, since you will be using a t-table with only limited number of degrees of freedom, you will use z-test when the sample size is large even though the population standard deviation is unknown.</p>
            <p>When sample sizes are small, the Central Limit Theorem does not apply. You must then impose stricter assumptions on the population to give statistical validity to the test procedure. One common assumption is that the population from which the sample is taken has a normal probability distribution to begin with. Under such circumstances, if the population standard deviation is known, then the test statistic <strong>𝑥̅−𝜇ₒ / (𝜎/√𝑛)</strong> still has the standard normal distribution.</p>
