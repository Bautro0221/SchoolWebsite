        <h1>Lesson 1: Formulating Evaluative Statements</h1>
        <p>Congratulations! You have successfully completed the preceding module. At this point, you will be guided to master a new competency which will help you become a better critical reader and thinker. Have you ever experienced arguing with a reading material as if it could respond and defend itself? If so, this module will help you understand those instances better. Before proceeding, don't forget to answer the pretest. So, what are you waiting for? Let’s start!</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>In this lesson, you are expected to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify types of assertions;</li>
            <li>Formulate assertions and evaluative statements; and</li>
            <li>Write evaluative statements and an evaluation about the content and properties of a written text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is It</h2>
        <p>How did you choose your preferred graduation gift? What did you notice about the statements you have written? For sure, you had your own bases and considerations for your choice. Similarly, when evaluating a reading text, you need to consider evidence to validate your assertions or claims.</p>

        <h2>What is an Evaluative Statement?</h2>
        <p>An evaluative statement expresses one's sound judgment about something, supported by reasons and evidence. It highlights strengths and weaknesses based on a set of criteria that is factual, substantial, and unbiased.</p>

        <h2>How to Formulate an Evaluative Statement</h2>
        <p>To formulate an evaluative statement, carefully read and critically analyze the text to identify potential fallacies in the argument. Consider the following tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin with positives before pointing out negatives. Your statement should be factual, substantial, and unbiased.</li>
            <li>Suggest solutions or improvements and justify how these will work.</li>
            <li>Keep your feedback concise and precise.</li>
            <li>Express evaluations with care and diligence.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <h2>Example:</h2>
            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A student composed a concrete poem about the COVID-19 pandemic in the shape of a dove. The poem used figurative language and imagery effectively but suffered from forced rhymes.</p>

            <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p>
            <p>1) The poem has a good physical and grammatical arrangement, enhancing the reader's experience. The theme is timely and gives hope during the pandemic. Figurative language and imagery add quality to the composition. The use of a dove-shaped structure contributes to understanding the poem's meaning.</p>
            <p>2) However, the forced rhymes affected the emotional connection with readers.</p>
            <p>3) To improve, use appropriate language over rhyme to better express emotions and meaning. A poem does not require rhyme but should prioritize meaning and emotional appeal.</p>

        <h2>Assertion and Its Types</h2>
        <p>A critical reader evaluates claims logically. Assertions are declarative sentences that express beliefs and may not necessarily be true. They often use evaluative language like "useful," "important," or "impressive." Assertions can be classified as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fact:</strong> Statements that can be objectively proven. <br><em>Example:</em> Experts say seawater contains high amounts of minerals.</li>
            <li><strong>Convention:</strong> Statements based on customs, traditions, or norms. <br><em>Example:</em> Seawater is classified as a heterogeneous and homogeneous mixture.</li>
            <li><strong>Opinion:</strong> Statements based on facts but difficult to verify due to ambiguities. <br><em>Example:</em> Swimming in seawater is the best way to relax.</li>
            <li><strong>Preference:</strong> Personal choices that are subjective and cannot be proven. <br><em>Example:</em> I prefer trips to places with seawater over those without it.</li>
        </ul>
